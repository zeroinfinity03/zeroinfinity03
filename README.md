# 👋 Welcome to my Repo!

## 🌟 About Me

### AI/ML Engineer who builds intelligent systems that actually ship — from real-time fraud detection pipelines processing millions of daily events to GenAI assistants serving 160K+ monthly queries.

Professionally, I've built production ML systems in financial services — real-time fraud risk scoring with PyTorch and Kafka, RAG-powered support tools with LangChain and FAISS, graph-based fraud network detection with Neo4j, anomaly detection models that prevented $32M+ in losses, and end-to-end MLOps across 25+ production models using Docker, Kubernetes, and MLflow.

On the side, I build AI tools people can actually use — a multimodal chatbot that runs fully local on quantized Llama, an algospeak-aware content moderation system fine-tuned with QLoRA, an MCP server that lets LLMs query databases through natural language, and more. I like taking messy problems and turning them into clean, usable products.

**Interested in:** LLM Applications · RAG Pipelines · Agentic Workflows · Local/Offline AI · Production ML Systems · MLOps
