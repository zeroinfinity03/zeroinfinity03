# üëã Welcome to the ZeroInfinity Repository!

## üåü About Me

### I‚Äôm a data scientist and developer. I‚Äôve built forecasting models, classification systems, and LLM-powered applications, and deployed scalable microservices using FastAPI, Docker, and CI/CD on AWS and GCP. My work spans classical machine learning and GenAI, with a focus on turning data into usable insights, building full-stack systems, and delivering end-to-end solutions that make an impact.
