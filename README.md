# 👋 Welcome to my Repo!

## 🌟 About Me

### I'm love building projects integrating AI that people can use in their everyday lives, with a Master's in Information Systems (Data Science) and a background in Computer Science, I enjoy working at the intersection of software engineering and machine learning.

I have worked on things like an AI summarization agent for form reviews, a natural language “data analyst” that answers questions on top of CSV data, a multimodal chatbot that runs locally, and a content moderation system that understands algo-speak. I like taking messy data or workflows and turning them into simple products.

I am especially interested in LLM applications, RAG pipelines, agent-style workflows, and local/offline AI. Most days you will find me coding, reading AI papers, trying new open source models, or writing and sharing what I learn.
