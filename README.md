## 🌟 About Me

### I'm love building projects integrating AI, and si am syitll learning daily , with a Master's in Information Systems (Data Science) from California State University, Fullerton. I specialize in building intelligent applications using Large Language Models, RAG pipelines, and agentic workflows.

My journey spans from developing AI summarization agents and natural language data analysts to building multimodal chatbots and content moderation systems. I'm passionate about making AI accessible and practical.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new AI research papers, contributing to open-source projects, or writing technical articles on Medium


I love building projects integrating AI. I have a Master’s in Data Science and a background in Computer Science, and I enjoy working at the intersection of software engineering and machine learning.

I have worked on things like an AI summarization agent for form reviews, a natural language “data analyst” that answers questions on top of CSV data, a multimodal chatbot that runs locally, and a content moderation system that understands algo-speak. I like taking messy data or workflows and turning them into simple products.

I am especially interested in LLM applications, RAG pipelines, agent-style workflows, and local/offline AI. Most days you will find me coding, reading AI papers, trying new open source models, or writing articles on medium.
